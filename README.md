_Battered and beaten, black and blue, the Earth is in dire need of rescuing. Can you find a silver lining to this story and get the aliens of Graytone to wave their white flag? Or will you be too yellow-bellied to venture into the Gray Area and fight Spectrum? I think the answer here is pretty black and white. Or red and orange and yellow and green and blue and indigo and violet, rather._

# Story ü¶é
Our story follows Prismo Newton, a colorful and charasmatic chameleon empassioned by his love of teaching art and encouraging his students to chase rainbows by showing off their true colors! Prismo is simply tickled pink as he walks home and reminisces about the wonderful day he spent teaching color theory to the kids at Crayon Academy. But still, being a teacher is hard work, so Prismo falls fast asleep the second his head hits the pillow.

Then, out of othe blue, troubled started. With Chameleon City sound asleep, the Graytones, cruising in their space ship high up in the pitch black night, green with envy of the city, saw this as their golden opportunity to take control of the area. Using their highly-advanced color-stealing technology, they got to work vaccumming every tint, tone, and tinge that had formerly decorated the newly-turned gray metropolis. 

Almost as if he knew something was wrong, Prismo leaped from his bed, went outside, and looked around. When he caught the aliens red-handed and noticed what they were trying to do, he turned as white as a sheet! Though, to be frank, it was more of a gray hue, but that's beside the point. Will you help Prismo defeat the Graytones and give color back to Chameleon City? Or will you wave the white flag? After all, if the Graytones' plans succeed, a white flag is just about one of the only colors of flag you'll be waving if you don't.

# How to Play üé®

## Objective üö©

Put an end to the monotonous madness the Graytones caused -- run to the end of the level dodging obstacles and eating bugs along the way, find the Gray Area, and defeat Spectrum! The world is in your once-colorful hands!

## Controls üèÉü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Prismo has legs and he knows how to use them! He'll run automatically and all you have to do is help him jump over obstacles and use his colorful tongue to clean up the Graytones.

Simply click the _JUMP_ button to make him jump and the _ATTACK_ button to have Prismo spit out his tongue.

The scientists in Chameleon City risked their lives for these pictures, so hopefully they help you in knowing what the aliens look like!

## Gameplay

If you touch any Graytones with his tongue they'll become friendly and won't attack Prismo. Watch out, though, touching a unfriendly Graytone will cause Prismo to lose a life! 

Got a friend that wants to play too? No problem! Have your friend help Prismo reach the dragonflies floating just out of reach by swiping them towards our fierce protagonist. How's a chameleon going to save the planet on an empty stomach? ü¶ã

## Final Boss

_Spoiler alert!_ Once you've ran past the first couple of levels you should find the home of Spectrum -- an extremely dangerous Graytone that seems to be the brains of this whole operation. He attacks with a gun that spits out large black gobs of goo that seem to be made up of the same stuff Graytones are made of. See if you can use your tongue to deflect some of these attacks and take down Spectrum for good!
